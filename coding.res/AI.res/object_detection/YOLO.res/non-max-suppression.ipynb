    "0. Before we do NMS, we have a basic threshold this is not the IOU_threshold, this threshold is just to remove bboxes with a low confidence score. then do the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Example: we get 3 bboxes \n",
    "<img src=\"./ref_imgs/during-nms.png\" alt=\"Description\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "    1. each of them have a probability score associated with that box 0.3, 0.9, 0.6, the probability is bewteen 0-1 and it indicts how likely that there is an object in that bbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We grab the highest bbox which in this case is the one with a 0.9 probability\n",
    "<img src=\"./ref_imgs/nms-01.png\" alt=\"Description\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then we compare it with the other boxes that have a lower probability, and we calculate the IOU between them, example IOU = between 0.9 vs 0.6 bboxes = 0.51\n",
    "<img src=\"./ref_imgs/nms-02.png\" alt=\"Description\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "    1. if the result is higher than an IOU_threshold, like 0.5 then we remove the 0.6 bbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. then we compare the 0.9 and 0.3 bboxes, example IOU result = 0.6, which is higher than out IOU_threshold, so we remove the 0.3 bbox\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If we have multiple class predictions in the image, example: a car and a horse, then we need to do NMS for each different class separately.\n",
