### How To Compile Code:

```shell
    # Compile using Clang++
    clang++ fileName.cpp -o compiled_cpp/fileName

    # Run the code
    ./compiled_code/fileName
```

### C++

- C++ is is widely used in systems programming, game development, high-performance computing, and embedded systems. C++ is a compiled language, meaning source code is translated into machine code using a compiler like clang.

- **Mid-level Language:** It is often called a **"mid-level"** language because it combines the features of a high-level language (like object-oriented programming) with the ability to perform low-level, direct memory manipulation. This gives developers fine-grained control over system resources.

- **Performance:** Being a compiled language, C++ code is converted into native machine code, which executes very quickly. It offers significantly more performance than languages like Python.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** C++ is an object-oriented language, which allows for a clean, modular, and reusable code structure. Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism help in managing large and complex codebases.

- **Portability:** C++ is portable across different devices at the source code level, but not at the binary level. This means you can often recompile the same C++ source code for different systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, to create a native executable for each platform.
